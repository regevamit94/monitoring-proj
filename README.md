**# monitoring-proj**
In this task, I have installed the Prometheus&Grafana on an existing gcloud cluster. I have also created my own dashboard using custom querys as for my own cluster's monitoring needs.
I have configured Variables on the project dashboard to make the dashboard more dynamic. 


As I said, I used an existing gcloud cluster. but if a new cluster in needed, this is how to create it with GCP cli:
"gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone=[ZONE] --num-nodes=[NUM_OF_NODES]"
